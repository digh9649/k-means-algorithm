In this project I implemented the K-means algorithm to analyze varieties of irises to see if we can classify them to their correct species based on their features.
The three species are: versicolor, setosa, virginica.

I implemented this algorithm so that there are three clusters to classify the data. When using the KMeans Model, I also used three clusters.
Using the K-means algorithm and the true clusterings of the irises, compare the percent matched. 
Then repeat using the KMeans Model.

Using the algorithm I implemented, the percent matched is 88.67%. Using the KMeans Model the percent matched is 89.33%.
